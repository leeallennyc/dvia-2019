## Summary of Universe Clock
The universe clock created investigates the nature of spirals and circular time. 
The inner red radial arc sweeps around indicating seconds passed. 
The middle red radial arc sweeps to indicate minutes in the day. 
The outer red radial arc sweeps to indicate hours passed over 24 hours (Military Time).

The retinal variables used to convey the seconds, mins, and hours are related to position, shape, and hue. The location of the arcs are on the outer most periphery, and the sweeping mimics the rotation of a typical clock, adding familiarity. Transparency is added to the red as to not become a distraction for other elements on the canvas.  

An ellipse grows in the center to indicate the passing of a week. 
We are also using position, color, shape, the changing of size as retinal variables for the spirals and center ellipse. 
A new spiral pattern will emerge and background will change color every season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn). Here we are using muted tones in the background as to not add too much distraction.
Autumn will change to dark grey, Winter will shift to moderate grey, Spring will shift to light grey, and Summer, to white. 
The new spiral pattern will emerge at the beginning of every new season (Dec, March, June, Sept), and will grow outward over the course of the season to expand beyond the canvas. 
Similar to a universe or star being born.
