### Desription of Project
For this project, I'm experimenting with the radial nature of time and spirals.   

### Concept Sketches for Clock
Some sketches are included in the Process Folder.

### Retinal variables Pdf from Week 1
This Pdf. was included as a reference to the visual vocabulary used. 

### Summary
The final clock created investigates the nature of spirals and circular time.
The inner red radial hand sweeps around indicating seconds passed.
The middle red radial arc sweeps to indicate minutes in the day.
The outer red radial arc sweeps to indicate hours passed over 24 hours (Military Time).

An ellipse grows in the center to indicate the passing of a week. 
A new spiral pattern will emerge and background will change color every season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn).
Autumn will change to dark grey,  Winter will shift to moderate grey, Spring will shift to light grey, and Summer, to white. 
The new spiral pattern will be very small at the beginning of every new season (Dec, March, June, Sept), and will grow outward over the course of the season to expand beyond the canvas. Similar to a universe being born every season.
