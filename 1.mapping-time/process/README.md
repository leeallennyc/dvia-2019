## Process Documentation

### Desription of Project
For this project, I'm considering time from the perspective of life expenctancy.
Please see this [Google Doc Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lh7YXZiOSmRGrPLbiL6KNFXwQ1t4FvO-82HJdejXvdE/edit?usp=sharing) for reference. One will be able to set their age and location, and the life expectancy will come up. The clock will be a reminder for those to live life fully as the countdown continues. 

### Concept Sketches for Clock
Some sketches are included in the Process Folder. Both DataVisualization_Aesthetics_Week2_ClockSketches.pdf and the Spiraltime_Sketches.pdf are used as reference for the coming work.

### Retinal variables Pdf from Week 1
This Pdf. was included as a reference to the visual vocabulary used.
