### Desription of Project
For this project, I'm considering time from the perspective of life expectancy.
Please see this [Google Doc Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lh7YXZiOSmRGrPLbiL6KNFXwQ1t4FvO-82HJdejXvdE/edit?usp=sharing) for reference. One will be able to set their age and location, and the life expectancy will come up. The clock will be a reminder for those to live life fully as the countdown continues. I'm experimenting with the idea of making this a 3D project with the use of WEBGL. 

### Concept Sketches for Clock
