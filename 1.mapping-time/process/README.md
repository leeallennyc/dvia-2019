### Desription of Project
For this project, I'm experimenting with the radial nature of time, while also looking at life expectancy and spirals.  
Please see this [Google Doc Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lh7YXZiOSmRGrPLbiL6KNFXwQ1t4FvO-82HJdejXvdE/edit?usp=sharing) for reference. My goal is to have one set their age and location, and the life expectancy eventually integrated in to the spiral clocks. 

### Concept Sketches for Clock
Some sketches are included in the Process Folder.

* DataVisualization_Aesthetics_Week2_ClockSketches.pdf 
* DataVisualization_Aesthetics_Week3_ClockSketches.pdf.
* Spiraltime_Sketches.pdf are used as reference for the coming work.

### Retinal variables Pdf from Week 1
This Pdf. was included as a reference to the visual vocabulary used.
