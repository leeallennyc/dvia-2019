## Process

The attached PDFs summarize my process. 

I will be looking at earthquake data, volcanic eruption activity data, and coordinates around The Pacific Plate and how each is related to the [The Ring of Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire). My goal is to be able to fly into specific areas around The Ring of Fire and tell a story regarding those places related to recent data for the USGS. Specifically, I'll be looking at differences in locations related to magnitude and number of active volcanoes. 

### Data Used
GeoJSON data related to active geographic and geologic information for worldwide volcanoes active since 1960. The data is a collection of information by Smithsonian Institution volcanologists and is drawn from the Volcanoes of the World (VOTW) database maintained by the Smithsonian's Global Volcanism Program (GVP). [Source](https://doi.org/10.5479/si.GVP.VOTW4-2013) 

Additional data was adapted from Simkin and Siebert, 1994 "Volcanoes of the World: an Illustrated Catalog of Holocene Volcanoes and their Eruptions" and produced digitally by the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program. [Source](https://earthworks.stanford.edu/catalog/harvard-glb-volc)

Earthquake data is provided by USGS - [Source](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
