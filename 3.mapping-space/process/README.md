## Process

The attached PDFs summarize my process. 

I will be looking at earthquake data, volcanic sites, and coordinates around The Pacific Plate and how each is related to the [The Ring of Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire). 

### Recent Additions
I've imported GeoJSON data related to point coverage containing basic geographic and geologic information for worldwide volcanoes thought to have been active in the last 10,000 years (Holocene). The data is a collection of information by Smithsonian Institution volcanologists summarizing 1,509 volcanoes and the version of the data was published as part of the USGS Global GIS : global coverage database. The data was adapted from Simkin and Siebert, 1994 "Volcanoes of the World: an Illustrated Catalog of Holocene Volcanoes and their Eruptions" and produced digitally by the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program.
