## Process
There are a number of sketches created as pdfs attached to provide a summary of my process. 

The final poster - Nuclear_project_LeeKuczewski_18x24.pdf - is best downloaded with adobe reader and zoomed in on for details.  

## Summary:
The results were based on [Johnston's Nuclear Data Archive](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/index.html) and Day of the week data was tranformed through a google apps script using [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/timezone/). I compared 5 countries across day and time of data cross sections. Timezone information was converted through UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) to the location of testing. 

Download the PDF and Zoom in to see the details of each country.
