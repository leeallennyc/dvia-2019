## Process

The sketches in the pdfs attached contain a summary of the data that I will be using for my nuclear testing dataset. I will be looking at the 20 largest yielding nuclear tests related to economic movements. Specifically I will track the week before, during, and after the bomb against the measurement of the S&P 500 historical daily changes in the stock market. 

I will be using data from [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/charts/stock-indexes) and the [Johnston's Archive](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/tests/USA-ntests0.html)
