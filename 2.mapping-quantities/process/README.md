## Process
The sketches in the pdfs attached contain a summary of the data that I've researched, and will be using for my nuclear testing dataset. Day of the week data will be used and compared to time of day data for nuclear testing across 5 countries. I've created a google apps script using Moment.js to convert timezones according to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)/GMT. 

The data used will be based off of the nuclear testing dataset provided in class.
