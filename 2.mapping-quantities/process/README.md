## Process
There are a number of sketches created as pdfs and pngs attached to provide a summary of my process. 

The final poster - Nuclear_project_LeeKuczewski_18x24.pdf is best downloaded with adobe reader and zoomed in on for details. Also please look at nuclear_fingerprints.png as a supplemental resource.  

## Summary:
The results were based on [Johnston's Nuclear Data Archive](http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/index.html) and Day of the week data was tranformed through a google apps script using [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/timezone/). I compared 5 countries across day and time of data cross sections. Timezone information was converted through UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) to the location of testing. 

Download the PDF and Zoom in to see the details of each country. 

The concept-5.html / concept-5.js will take about 10 seconds to load, but is a final working version of parsing over ~ +26,000 days between 1945-2017 and adding a "Nuclear fingerprint" for each country on each day. The outcome can be seen in nuclear_fingerprints.png as a supplemental resource. 

## Post Class:
I will be working on this project post-semester to take the nuclear fingerprints data and convert it to a music composition using each testing day as a MIDI signal with Tone.js and other libraries.
