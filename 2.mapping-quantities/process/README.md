## Process

The sketches in the pdfs attached contain a summary of the data that I will be using for my nuclear testing dataset. 
My goal is to link the historical activity of nuclear testing to innovation and Intellectual Property happening within that time frame.

Some sources for the IP data can be found through the API [here](http://www.patentsview.org/api/patent.html) and possible narrative imagery from the [USPTO](http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html).
